# Individual Project

This is my Individual project for university of reading. This is a virtual campus covering most of the major buildings. Hopefully. This project has been built using unity. Most of the buildings/props have been made using sketchup/unity.

This GitHub does not cover all of the updates made in this project before 21st February 2018 as this project wasn't uploaded to github before then. The logbook inside the documents folder will cover all of the updates that are currently missing from github.

If you wish to test the app out. Check out the releases section at the top. You'll need a Android Device running Nougat or Higher (With VR capabilities) and a Daydream headset.
